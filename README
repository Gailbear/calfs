Team Serendipity presents Cory And gaiL's File System (CALFS).

Inode is a file system that makes use of meta-information so that it is extremely flexible.

We chose Inode as our disk layout for many reasons.
1) It doesn't take up a fixed amount of room on the disk
2) It makes more sense to us to have the file metadata store the
directory entries.
3) It makes the extra credit much much easier.
4) One of the team members thinks FAT is very silly, and that Inode
makes much more sense to her.

Inode implementation details subject to change before the final
version of the project.
